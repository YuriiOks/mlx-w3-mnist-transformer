Perfect starting point, Yurii! 🎯  
Let’s take these **fundamental concepts of Transformers** — **Query (Q)**, **Key (K)**, and **Value (V)** — and explain each in **full professional detail**, step-by-step.

---

# **🔖 Query (Q), Key (K), Value (V) in Transformers: Full Deep Dive 🔍🔑💎**

---

## **1️⃣ QUERY (Q) 🔍**

---

### **💡 Real-Life Analogy**
Imagine you are **asking a question** at a conference:
- "**Who can help me with Machine Learning?**" 🧠

✅ Your **query** is **your question** — what you're **looking for** among all participants.

---

### **📌 Definition**
| Concept | Definition |
|:--------|:-----------|
| **Query (Q)** | A vector representing **what the current token (position)** wants to **find or focus on** in the sequence. |

✅ It defines the **intent** or **search criteria** for attention.

---

### **🧮 Mathematical View**
At each position $ t $:
- The input embedding $ x_t $ is projected via a learned matrix $ W_Q $:
$$
Q_t = W_Q \cdot x_t
$$

✅ Query vectors have the same dimension as Key vectors.

---

### **🔄 Step-by-Step Process**
1. Take the token's embedding.
2. Linearly project it using the **Query matrix** $ W_Q $.
3. Use the Query vector to **compare** against all Keys.
4. Higher similarity = higher attention weight!

---

### **📊 Example (English Sentence)**
| Token  | Query Example |
|--------|---------------|
| "the"  | Looking for nearby nouns |
| "big"  | Looking for adjectives |

✅ Each token **wants to find** different information!

---

### **🚀 Real-World Applications**
- In language models: Word "bank" queries if it's talking about "river" or "finance."
- In vision models: A patch queries its neighboring patches for context.

---

### **🔍 Key Insights**
- Query = **What am I looking for?** 🧐
- Query is **dynamic** and changes at every position.

---

### **🔥 Final Takeaways**
✅ Query vector tells the model **what each position is searching for** in the sequence.  
✅ Without a Query, attention would have no direction!

---

# **2️⃣ KEY (K) 🔑**

---

### **💡 Real-Life Analogy**
Imagine each person at the conference wears a **badge** describing their expertise:
- "I know Machine Learning."  
- "I know Cooking."  
- "I know Business."  

✅ Each **badge** is the **Key** — what **information** each participant **offers**!

---

### **📌 Definition**
| Concept | Definition |
|:--------|:-----------|
| **Key (K)** | A vector representing **what information each token contains or offers** to the rest of the sequence. |

✅ It defines **what each token brings to the table**!

---

### **🧮 Mathematical View**
For token $ t $:
$$
K_t = W_K \cdot x_t
$$
where $ W_K $ is a learned weight matrix for Keys.

✅ Keys and Queries interact through dot-products to compute attention scores.

---

### **🔄 Step-by-Step Process**
1. Take token's embedding.
2. Linearly project it using the **Key matrix** $ W_K $.
3. Each Key waits to be **queried**.

---

### **📊 Example (English Sentence)**
| Token  | Key Example |
|--------|-------------|
| "bank" | Could offer "finance meaning" or "river side meaning." |
| "fast" | Offers "adjective describing speed." |

✅ Key defines **what a word can offer** when queried.

---

### **🚀 Real-World Applications**
- Disambiguating meaning in NLP tasks.
- Representing different patches' "contents" in images.

---

### **🔍 Key Insights**
- Key = **What do I have to offer?** 💬
- Key is **static** per token (doesn’t change across queries).

---

### **🔥 Final Takeaways**
✅ Key vector tells **what information** is contained in each token, ready to be compared against queries.  
✅ Keys allow **dynamic flexible search** between different tokens!

---

# **3️⃣ VALUE (V) 💎**

---

### **💡 Real-Life Analogy**
Imagine once you find the right expert at the conference:
- They **share valuable knowledge** or **give a document**! 📄

✅ That **document** or **knowledge** is the **Value**.

---

### **📌 Definition**
| Concept | Definition |
|:--------|:-----------|
| **Value (V)** | A vector representing the **actual content or information** to be transferred when attention is given. |

✅ Value carries **the useful payload**!

---

### **🧮 Mathematical View**
For token $ t $:
$$
V_t = W_V \cdot x_t
$$
where $ W_V $ is a learned weight matrix for Values.

✅ Values are **aggregated** (summed, weighted) after attention scores are computed.

---

### **🔄 Step-by-Step Process**
1. Take token's embedding.
2. Linearly project it using **Value matrix** $ W_V $.
3. After calculating attention weights, **combine values** weighted by attention.

---

### **📊 Example (English Sentence)**
| Token  | Value Example |
|--------|---------------|
| "bank" | Full semantic vector representing "bank" meaning. |
| "fast" | Detailed feature vector describing speed-related concept. |

✅ After querying and matching keys, **we gather the Values**!

---

### **🚀 Real-World Applications**
- Producing outputs in NLP (next token prediction).
- Summarizing features from different regions in Vision Transformers.

---

### **🔍 Key Insights**
- Value = **Actual information to extract** 📜.
- Value is **not involved in computing attention weights** — only used after.

---

### **🔥 Final Takeaways**
✅ Value vectors hold the **final content** that is gathered after attention is computed.  
✅ Keys and Queries decide **where to attend**, Values deliver **what is attended**!

---

# **🚀 Super Final Recap Table**

| Component | Simple Meaning | Technical Purpose |
|:----------|:----------------|:------------------|
| **Query (Q)** 🔍 | What I'm searching for | Used to compute attention scores |
| **Key (K)** 🔑 | What I can offer | Compared with Query to find matches |
| **Value (V)** 💎 | The knowledge I share | Actual information returned |

---

✅ Now you have a **full deep, structured understanding** of **Query, Key, and Value** — the absolute heart of Transformers! 🔥📚

---

Awesome question, Yurii! 🔥  
Now let's carefully connect **Q/K/V Attention** to our **Vision Transformer for MNIST project** — making it **super concrete**.

---

# **🔖 How Q, K, V (Attention) Are Used in Our Vision Transformer for MNIST 🖼️🤖**

---

## **💡 Real-Life Analogy: Group Study for an Exam 📚👥**

Imagine you split a **big exam textbook** into **small topics** (patches).  
- You are trying to **study** one topic but **ask around** your study group:
  - "Hey, who has useful notes on this part?" (Query)
  - Everyone offers their notes (Keys).
  - You read and use the most helpful notes (Values).

✅ This is exactly what happens in our MNIST Vision Transformer:  
- Each **patch** (part of the digit) tries to **gather useful information from other patches** via attention.

---

## **📌 Definition: Usage in MNIST-ViT**

| Role | In MNIST Project |
|:-----|:-----------------|
| **Query (Q)** 🔍 | Each patch **asks**: “What other patches should I pay attention to?” |
| **Key (K)** 🔑 | Each patch **offers**: “This is what I have about the digit's shape.” |
| **Value (V)** 💎 | Each patch **shares**: “Here’s the detailed information I carry.” |

✅ This process **enables patches to collaborate** to recognize curves, loops, and edges — building a full understanding of the digit!

---

## **🔄 Step-by-Step How It Works**

1️⃣ **Image Split into Patches**  
- (28×28) image split into (7×7) patches → 16 patches.

2️⃣ **Patch Embedding**  
- Each patch flattened and projected into a 64-dimensional vector.

3️⃣ **For Each Patch**:  
- Create a **Query vector (Q)** to search for information.
- Create a **Key vector (K)** to offer information.
- Create a **Value vector (V)** to carry content.

4️⃣ **Attention Calculation**:
- Compute similarity between **this patch's Query** and **all patches' Keys**.
- Apply Softmax → get attention weights.
- Weighted sum over **all Values** → **new updated patch representation**.

5️⃣ **Stack multiple self-attention layers**:
- Higher layers combine **global clues** about the entire digit (e.g., recognizing “0” as a loop).

6️⃣ **Classifier Head**:
- Finally, predict the digit class (0–9).

✅ Thanks to Attention, **all patches** collaborate to recognize the digit even if a feature (like a corner stroke) is **spread across different regions**.

---

## **📈 Diagram: Attention inside MNIST ViT**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Patch1 --> Q1[Query1]
    Patch2 --> K2[Key2]
    Patch2 --> V2[Value2]
    Q1 --Dot Product--> K2
    Q1 --Attention Weight--> V2
    V2 --Weighted Sum--> Updated Patch1
```

✅ Every patch talks to every other patch **via Q/K/V attention**.

---

## **📊 Example Table: Attention Between Patches**

| Patch A (top-left) | Patch B (bottom-left) | Patch C (bottom-right) |
|:-------------------|:---------------------|:----------------------|
| 0.7 (strong attention) | 0.2 (weak) | 0.1 (very weak) |

✅ Top-left patch heavily attends to nearby patch because they together **form part of a "3" curve**!

---

## **🚀 Why Attention Matters for MNIST Digits**

| Challenge | How Attention Helps |
|:----------|:--------------------|
| Curves split across patches | Patches communicate to reconstruct full curve shape. |
| Dealing with noisy pixels | Patches focus only on **relevant neighbors**. |
| Understanding digit topology | Attention lets patches combine local edges into global digit structure. |

✅ In normal CNNs, you need many convolutions to gradually expand the receptive field.  
✅ In ViTs, **attention gives global view instantly**! 🔍

---

## **🔥 Final Takeaways**

1️⃣ In MNIST ViT, **each patch queries** other patches using **Q/K/V attention**. 🔍🔑💎  
2️⃣ **Patches dynamically collaborate** to build an understanding of digits. 🧩  
3️⃣ Attention allows ViT to **reason globally** — even small parts know about the big picture! 🌎  
4️⃣ This is why even **tiny ViTs** perform well on MNIST with the right setup. 🚀
