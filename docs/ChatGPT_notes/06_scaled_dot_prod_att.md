Alright, Yurii! 🚀  
Let's **focus first on Scaled Dot-Product Attention**, and we’ll treat it as **the true mathematical heart** of the Transformer (and of our MNIST Vision Transformer as well!).  
I will explain it fully following our structured deep approach:

## **💡 Real-Life Analogy: Group Voting at a Meeting 🗳️👥**

Imagine you're at a meeting and **asking for advice** on a decision.
- You ask everyone (Query 🔍).
- Each person offers their credentials (Keys 🔑).
- You **compare your question** to everyone's credentials (Dot Product 🧮).
- You **trust some opinions more** (Softmax 🧠).
- Finally, you **combine their advice** based on trust levels (Weighted Values 💎).

✅ This is exactly how **Scaled Dot-Product Attention** works!

---

## **📌 Definition**

| Step | Purpose |
|:-----|:--------|
| **Dot Product** | Compute raw compatibility between Query and Key. |
| **Scaling** | Divide scores by $\sqrt{d_k}$ to stabilize gradients. |
| **Softmax** | Turn raw scores into probabilities (attention weights). |
| **Weighted Sum** | Create the final output as a mixture of Values. |

✅ The mechanism **decides where to focus** given a Query!

## **🧮 Mathematical View (Full Equations)**

Given:
- Query matrix $ Q \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d_k} $
- Key matrix $ K \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d_k} $
- Value matrix $ V \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d_v} $

The **attention output** is computed as:

1. **Compatibility (raw scores)**:
$$
\text{Score} = QK^T
$$

2. **Scaling**:
$$
\text{Scaled Score} = \frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}
$$

3. **Softmax (Attention Weights)**:
$$
\alpha = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)
$$

4. **Weighted Summation (Context Output)**:
$$
\text{Attention}(Q,K,V) = \alpha V
$$

✅ **Dot → Scale → Softmax → Weighted Sum**!

## **🔄 Step-by-Step Process**

1️⃣ **Dot Product**  
- Compare Queries with all Keys to measure **relevance**.

2️⃣ **Scale by $\sqrt{d_k}$**  
- If dimensions are large, dot products grow huge.
- Scaling prevents the Softmax from becoming extremely sharp (gradient vanishing).

3️⃣ **Apply Softmax**  
- Normalize scaled scores to **probability distribution** (sum to 1).

4️⃣ **Weighted Summation**  
- Compute final output by **blending Values according to attention weights**.

✅ The model **chooses how much to attend** to each input token (or patch)!

---

## **📊 Example Table: Tiny Attention Scores**

| Patch A | Patch B | Patch C |
|:--------|:--------|:--------|
| 0.8     | 0.1     | 0.1     |

- After softmax → A gets 80% weight, B and C get 10% each.
- **Value vectors** are combined accordingly.

✅ More attention ➔ stronger influence in the final output!

## **🚀 How Scaled Dot-Product Attention Will Be Used in Our MNIST ViT Project**

| Component | Role in Project |
|:----------|:----------------|
| **Patch Query** 🔍 | Each patch **asks**: "Which other patches help me understand the digit?" |
| **Patch Keys** 🔑 | Each patch **offers** its feature information. |
| **Patch Values** 💎 | Each patch **shares** its encoded features. |
| **Attention Layer** | Calculates how patches **influence** each other’s understanding! |

✅ Attention **mixes features across patches** — for example:
- The **top stroke** of a "7" and the **middle stroke** collaborate via attention to understand the full digit shape.

✅ **Self-Attention** allows patches to understand **global relationships instantly**, unlike CNNs which expand slowly through local filters.

## **🔍 Key Insights**

- **Scaling by $\sqrt{d_k}$** is crucial for **gradient stability**.
- Attention is a **soft search mechanism** across the sequence.
- It lets **different parts of the input dynamically collaborate**.
- Without Attention, Transformers would be no better than vanilla MLPs!

## **🔥 Final Takeaways**

1️⃣ Scaled Dot-Product Attention = **Query–Key–Value Magic** 🎯  
2️⃣ **Scaling stabilizes training**, preventing gradient collapse. 📉  
3️⃣ **Softmax creates interpretable probability distributions** over inputs. 📊  
4️⃣ **Weighted sum produces rich context vectors**, fusing information! 🧵  
5️⃣ In MNIST-ViT, **patches use attention to globally reason about the digit** — better than convolution alone! 🔥
